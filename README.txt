1. This design document is for The Gaming Room, a company that makes games for users across multiple different operating systems. They wanted us to make them a design document for a program that is meant to work across the various operating systems, as well as on mobile devices. The program was a game called "Draw It or Lose It".

2. I believe that I addressed the needs of client in this documentation. I think if you look through it, every need they specified was addressed, such as security requirements, memory requirements, multi-platform requirements, and many others!

3. I think, regarding developing code, the most useful part of the documentation was using the UML design visuals to see how my classes would be set up and how everything related to itself. This was incredibly useful, especially when documenting the classes I would have in my code. 

4. I think if I were to revise any of the parts of the documentation, it would be the “Evaluation” portion. I have done a little more research onto possible development software for personal projects and I believe that while Draw It or Lose It does not require an incredibly advanced gaming engine such as Unreal or CryEngine, something like Unity, which is a little more powerful than what I recommended (Game Maker Studio) would suit the client well!

5. First, the users’ needs are important because they are the end consumer. They, inevitably, decide the fate of your software. If they like it, then it will be consumer. If they don’t, the program will fail. So, when documenting the software design, the users’ needs are a very important consideration. I incorporated their needs by trying to think of all the ways I have had the user experience be frustrating, and then thinking of ways to mitigate such problems. 

6. I think all of the readings I did for this course helped me with the designing of the software for sure. Visualizing the code was certainly helpful. Also, highlighting the needs of both the client and the users, as well as the needs of the developers, was very useful. I think this is the path I would take when designing similar types of applications in the future.
